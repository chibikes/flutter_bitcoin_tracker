## Getting Started
To get started make sure you have setup a <a href="https://www.coinapi.io/">coinapi</a> account.

create a config.dart file in the project's directory to store your coinapi apikey and remeber not to include the file when making commits to a public version control system (add config.dart file to your git-ignore file). For best practice, create a .env file and add the api key. Check out https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-api-keys-dart-define-env-files/ on some of the best practices used to secure api keys.

# Run app
Run the following command in your terminal to start app:
```bash
flutter run
```
